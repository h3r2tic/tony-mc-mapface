# ðŸŒˆ Tony McMapface ðŸŒˆ

Takes HDR Rec.709/sRGB stimulus, and maps it to LDR. It's tranquil and collected, and won't set your eyes ablaze.

## About

Tony is a display transform intended for real-time applications such as games. It is intentionally _boring_, does not increase contrast or saturation, and stays close to the input stimulus where compression isn't necessary.

It ships as a LUT along with a bit of shader code for sampling. There's no tweakables; if you need a different look, do it before and/or after the display transform.

Please note that the shader output is linear, so if "gamma space" sRGB is desired, the sRGB OETF must be used afterwards.

There's also a basic OCIO config with sRGB output.

_Disclaimer: Tony McMapface is phenomenological, and tuned to its author's visual system (with mixed success). If you need something mathematically pure, try [AgX](https://github.com/sobotka/AgX)._

## Ports ðŸ’–

* [DaVinci Resolve port](https://github.com/SergeyMakeev/tony-mc-mapface-fuse) by Sergey Makeev

## Derivation

The generator's source code will come at a later time. Meanwhile, here's a TL;DR:

Tony McMapface takes a maximalist approach to the image formation process, and explicitly models perceptual phenomena:

* Brightness-equivalent luminance of the input stimulus is compressed (accounting for the [Helmholtzâ€“Kohlrausch effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz%E2%80%93Kohlrausch_effect)).
  * The non-linearity resembles Reinhard.
* Color hues are preserved during compression, except for a deliberate [Bezoldâ€“BrÃ¼cke shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezold%E2%80%93Br%C3%BCcke_shift).
* To avoid posterization, selective desaturation is employed, with care to avoid the [Abney effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abney_effect).

As can be expected, the models underlying this process are imperfect, thus a liberal amount of eyeballing and fine tuning was applied.
